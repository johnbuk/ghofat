GHOFAT WANDERERS 0</p><p class="font_8">​​</p><p class="font_8">Having played Hellidon Lakes in 2017 and 2018 we were aware that the Hotel was being refurbished following our visits, (not that the GHOFAT group had trashed the venue during their visits !!) and it was taken over by a new owner shortly after - Interesting Hotels Group. </p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">It was decided to give Hellidon another visit for GHOFAT24 on the assumption that the anticipated improvements to the Hotel and golf course would make a return worthwhile.</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">Whilst the Hotel accommodation and catering were up to standard, reduced staff levels in the Hotel and lack of knowledgeable staff proved something of a challenge, but the few staff on duty did look after us very well.</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">Monday dawned dull but with no rain, so seventeen Ghofateers ventured out with high hopes of record-breaking rounds of golf. A few holes into the coveted BERNADEUTZ TROPHY round it became apparent that the golf course was also suffering from lack of loving care and attention, obviously due to reduced green staff. The first and second cuts off the fairway were covered with the grass cuttings that had not been collected. Any ball, slightly off line became almost impossible to find. Frustrating, but also time-consuming.</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">Record-breaking rounds soon became a distant dream as the golf continued. This was not helped by the handicap revisions metered out by Ken Smith. To be fair, Ken had availed himself of the SLOPE INDEX CHART, that in hindsight, we all thought was published in fairyland! HELLIDON is a very difficult golf course, and we were all cut shots from our WHS handicap. This made it even more difficult to score bankable points, so the cards were recording scores in the mid-teens for many players, with no one even approaching a net par round.</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">Following a stewards enquiry post match, Ken reluctantly bowed to a popular demand,and on the following day gave us all a revised "up tick" to our handicaps. This was greeted with much joy, and hope that the following day would result in better scores.</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">The evening dinner table was, as usual, a lively affair. The general opinion was that the catering was up to scratch and the service very good. A visiting Ladies Golf Society shared the dining room with GHOFAT ( completely separate from us of course), and during their and our prize giving ceremony it became apparent that the Ladies had scored a great deal better than us old farts. It added a little light-hearted banter to the evening, especially when we all toasted a happy birthday wish to dear old Bob Fell, whose birthday fell the following morning and the Ladies all stood up and sang Happy Birthday to Bob.</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">Tuesday dawned overcast and misty, which soon turned to light drizzle. Not very inviting for 18 holes of golf. However, we all set off to do battle, empowered by the increase in handicaps and a full English.</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">The rain sort of settled in, and by hole six mumbling amongst the natives was suggesting a 9 hole competition could be an option. This request was transmitted by jungle telephone rearwards and forwards to test opinions, and it was decided to call it a day after 9 holes. Unfortunately the first two groups had already ventured down the 10 <a dataquery="dGV4dExpbmtfbTBwajgzYWI=">hole. It</a> was their option to walk in, or play out the full 18 holes, in the knowledge that only the front 9 would count in the competition for today.</p><p class="font_8">So all in all, a mixed bag of golf and weather, but we all know that GHOFAT is about the players and the social contact, the golf is just the reason to get together every year.</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">GUESTS</p><p class="font_8">We welcomed two guests this year</p><p class="font_8">Neville Richardson, who travelled from Spain specifically for this event. Thank you Neville for taking the trouble and time to play wet golf on a sub standard English golf course.</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">Nick Townend</p><p class="font_8">BWS member and all round good guy, welcome Nick.</p><p class="font_8"> </p><p class="font_8"> RESULTS</p><p class="font_8"> </p><p class="font_8">Straightest  drive  MONDAY..................................................Nick Townend</p><p class="font_8">Longest drive       TUESDAY...................................................Alan Hawkins</p><p class="font_8"> </p><p class="font_8">NTP Hole 9           MONDAY...................................................Steve Hudson</p><p class="font_8">                              TUESDAY..................................................Ken Smith</p><p class="font_8"> </p><p class="font_8">NTP Hole 13         MONDAY....................................................John Billot</p><p class="font_8">                              TUESDAY...................................................Mr Nobody</p><p class="font_8"> </p><p class="font_8">Best guest score   MONDAY....................................................Neville Richardson</p><p class="font_8">                               TUESDAY...................................................Nick Townend</p><p class="font_8"> </p><p class="font_8">BERNADEUTZ TROPHY............................Winner.................Tony Slipper</p><p class="font_8">                                                                 Runner up...........Ken Smith</p><p class="font_8">(our guest Neville Richardson scored 29 points but as a first year guest cannot take the trophy)</p><p class="font_8"> </p><p class="font_8">TOSFAC TROPHY.......................................Winner................Tony Willcox</p><p class="font_8">                                                                   Runner up..........Leslie Vine</p><p class="font_8"> </p><p class="font_8">LENSHA TROPHY.......................................Winner................Ken Smith</p><p class="font_8">                                                                   Runner up..........Leslie Vine</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">GHOFAT TROPHY.......................................Winner...............Bob Blake</p><p class="font_8">                                                                   Runner up..........Henry Knight</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">Our two guests this year were given a GHOFAT golf ball to play with. The deal is that if they play with that ball and hand it to me during the prize giving, I will replace it with a sleeve of new balls. Neville was able to hand me back the GHOFAT ball and was rewarded with a sleeve of Titliest balls. Nick also handed me back the GHOFAT ball, but confessed that he didn't actually play with it, so no new balls for Nick.</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">The general consensus was that the event went as well as could be expected, bearing in mind the Hotel restricted staff situation, which in all honesty did little to affect the Hotel accommodation or catering service. Having no pro shop open was an inconvenience but, all being seasoned old farts, we muddled through.</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">Many thanks to Granddad's little helpers, Henry, Bob, Tony and John for the input on scores and cash collection.</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">Are we all still in business for 2025? No doubt I will get some feedback if there is a still desire to venture into the unknown, also any suggestions for 2025 venue and I will check it out.</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">That's all folks</p><p class="font_8">​</p><p class="font_8">Pip pip</p><p class="font_8">​​</p><p class="font_8">​For those wanting a reminder of the day <a href="https://billot.quickconnect.to/mo/sharing/psxnniOhP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLICK HERE</a> </p></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://johnbuk.github.io/ghofat/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=1ea8317abae2e05fa2a65ed7bbff7ba7"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
